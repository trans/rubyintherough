One is a library to help make one-liners even more terse.
It provides one to two letter aliases for a number of
classes, modules and methods, helping one to create very
tight one-liners. While a bit of a gag library, it could
be used for code obsfuscation too. It also includes a
collection of some notable Ruby one-liners.
