Build any kind hierachical structure programatically
via Ruby blocks. Buildable provides a backbone for
easily creating hierachical DSLs.


== FEATURES/ISSUES

* Define a special #build method and include. That's it.
* This is betaware. Code and docs need improvements.


== RELEASE NOTES

Please see RELEASE file.


== SYNOPSIS

Example of a very simplistic XML builder.

  class XMLBuilder

    include Buildable

    def build(tag, attrs={}, &body)
      attrs = attrs.map{ |k,v| %[#{k}="#{v}"] }
      "<#{tag} #{attrs.join(' ')}>#{body.call}</#{tag}>"
    end

  end

  doc = XMLBuilder.build do

    head do
      title { "Test" }
    end

    body do
      i { "Hello" }
      br
      p { "Test" }
      p { "Hey"  }
    end

  end


== HOW TO INSTALL
