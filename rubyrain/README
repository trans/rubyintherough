= RAIN

Rain was an idea to create a gem like package manager, but one that did not
depend on a central repo of packages. Rather the central repo only contained
"dropfiles" --YAML config files that specififed where to find the package, how
to retrieve it and how to install it.

The packages themselves could be gems, tar.gz files, or whatever and located
on the Internet where ever the maintainer wished.

The upside to this design is light-wieght central service, and flexability
for developers to host there work where ever they prefer. The downside, is
that older packages can often be lost --perhaps not so bad as it provides
a natural means of "weeding" out outdated code.

An interesting direction this could take, is P2P package distribution.
